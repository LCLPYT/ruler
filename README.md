# ruler
A Fabric mod for configuring rules for your Minecraft world.
This mod is aiming to be vanilla compatible.

## Features (WIP)
You can set rules via a command.
Rules impact the behaviour of different game mechanics.
For example, you can disable ice melting, coral death or water freezing.
You can choose to configure each dimension individually.
